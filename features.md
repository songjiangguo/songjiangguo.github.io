##Product Introduction
##  🚀  Welcome to the Notion toolset
Our toolkit is designed specifically for Notion users, providing a range of powerful features to help you organize information, manage projects, and automate workflows more efficiently. Currently, we have completed two tool templates, namely the export function of Notion diaries and the electronic wardrobe template. Both modules are built on the Notion platform, which means that users must be Notion users before they can use our toolkit. Below are separate introductions.

一、 Export function of notification diary（8.00$）

The official website of Notion platform is: https://www.notion.so/ This export tool is based on the Notion platform diary and exports diary and attribute content. Currently, the export on the Notion official platform either only exports diary attributes or diary content, and cannot export both attributes and content at the same time. Therefore, we have developed this feature to export both attributes and content,
Convenient for users to use. This export function is equipped with a diary template. Based on the provided diary template, users can use the developed export program to export the properties and content of the diary. It should be noted that this export program is developed based on Python 3.11, so users need to install the Python environment themselves. Users can go to the Python official website by themselves（ https://www.python.org/ ）Download and install, preferably Python 3.11 or above. After installation, run the program to use it.
###  ✨  Core functions

二、 Electronic wardrobe template（2.00$）

This electronic wardrobe template is also developed based on the Notion platform. It can be used immediately after purchase without the need for additional programs. The operation is simple and easy to use. In terms of collecting clothes purchased by users, it is mainly divided into two parts that are simple and easy to operate: creating new clothes and selecting combinations
New clothing:
When you need to enter new clothes into the electronic wardrobe, click the "New" button in the upper right corner of the template to enter your new clothes. Users can add the brand, price, category (must be selected, otherwise the matching of subsequent clothes cannot be selected), storage location, size, color and other attributes according to their preferences.
